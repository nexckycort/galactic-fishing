## Game Mechanics & Rules (40%)

Remember, at the final bell, the player who has reached the highest level (with
the most gold as a tiebreaker) will be crowned the champion of the stars. But
the real prize? That could be a permanent spot on our engineering team... ðŸŒŒâœ¨

### How the game works (plain and simple)

1. **Fish** â€” Type `/fish` to cast your line. You can do this **three times** in
   a row, then wait **30 seconds** before fishing again.
2. **Check your catch** â€” `/inventory` shows each fishâ€™s rarity, XP, and gold
   value.
3. **Decide**
   - `/eat <fish>` to turn the fish into XP and level up.
   - `/sell <fish>` (or `/sell all`) to gain gold.
4. **Buy or sabotage** â€” Spend gold in `/market` on:
   - **Enhanced Fishing Rod** â€” better odds for rare fish.
   - **Poison of Leveling** â€” permanently steals 1 level (+ that XP) from a
     rival and slows their fishing by 30 s.
   - **Poison of Delay** â€” adds 30 s to someoneâ€™s fishing cooldown (stacks up to
     5 min).
   - **Poison of Recovery** â€” removes 30 s of your own cooldown.

5. **Climb the leaderboard** â€” Levels decide rank; gold breaks ties.

### Extra Rules

- **Dynamic market** â€” Item prices can change, and limited-time items may appear
  without notice.
- **Alliances are allowed** â€” `/send-money <amount> <user>` to fund friends;
  `/message <text>` to chat (costs 100 gold).
